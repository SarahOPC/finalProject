# HRnet
Welcome to HRnet! This is our company's internal application to create and view employee records.

# Front in React
Due to limitations caused by jQuery code, the frontend part of this application has, now (11/2023), been built with React version 18.2.0.
All the code has been rewritten from scratch to offer a better user experience.

# Starting frontend
In the project directory/front, you can run:

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in browser.

The page will reload when developers make changes.\
Lint errors may be seen in the console.

# Project Context and Environment
The decision has been made to work in React and we have used React Router to manage our single-page application.
This is a way to simplify code and improve the user experience
